This the R Markdown document associated with my repository located at: https://github.com/thecapacity/RepData_PeerAssessment2

This document will be used to capture the results of my data analysis in order to make them reproducable, and will be published at my [RPubs Account](http://rpubs.com/thecapacity/).

This document will represent a stand alone assessment, but for more details please check out the [GitHub Repository](http://rpubs.com/thecapacity/).

```{r setoptions}
### Setup some defaults

# Ensure pristine working environment
## rm(list=ls())
## This has been commented out for submission to ensure no disruptivie side-effets for others

library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path="figure/", dev="png")
```

These global defaults are set, or suggested ```# As comments``` to ensure consistent behavior.
